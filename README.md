# VBA-Challenge
 Bootcamp VBA Homework Repository
Project Details:
The goal of this project was to create a VBA script that would loop through multiple years of stock data, and pull out specific values. The main factors we were pulling from the data was the ticker symbol, total stock volume for individual tickers, the yearly change per ticker, and the yearly percent change per ticker. Ultimately, my VBA script ran through the data from years 2014-2016 and pulled out these data points. My script also formatted the yearly change values to highlight as green for a postive change, or red for a negative change. Here are the screenshots for my results below:
